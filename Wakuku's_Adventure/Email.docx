Subject: Analysis Request - Suspicious Evidence Acquired

Dear Team,

During a routine forensics sweep at a recent raid on a suspected cybercriminal hideout, we came across an item that appears to be an ordinary postcard. However, preliminary analysis suggests it may contain a hidden message. The card was found tucked away in a safe alongside encrypted drives, suggesting its potential significance.

Your task is to analyze this evidence and uncover any hidden information. We've included the scanned postcard. Time is criticalâ€”if this card holds the key to something bigger, we need answers fast.

Let us know your findings as soon as possible.

Best regards,
Detective Wakuku
