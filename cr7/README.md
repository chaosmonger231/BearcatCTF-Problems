cr7 is a CTF problem created for MakeUC Hackathon 2024. The main CTF category is OSINT however I added multiple roadblocks to make things harder and interesting. The first roadblock is that all the files are put into zip configuration and password protected. The password is simple and can be found inside rockyou text files. Once unzip, the player will see a few images with some interesting file name and a text file configured to look like its not. The textfile contains hints as to where the location is. If the hints doesn't help, then they must create a program to merge the images.
